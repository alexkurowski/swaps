* Make an underline for score on menu screen (it's clickable, after all)
  Or maybe make some other button.

*** Menu redesign?
    Fuck global score system
    Only leave purchase option on the screen when you done your amount of pops?..
    There are only 2 options, if we remove name. Might as well fit them right on the main menu screen.
    Maybe there is a gear icon on top-left, and when you tap it, it opens a small container of two more icons for music and vibro.
    Then there is a small icon on top-right for "?" about screen.
    Blockr+ is integred with main screen, or maybe the "?" icon moves to the center, while "b" button is on top-right.


** Menu with [play], [settings], [scores] & [about] buttons ("PLAY!", gear icon, leader piedestal, "?" respectively)
  Also shows unlocked emoticons (but doesn't show number of locked emoticons, no one will probably see 6x6 one)

* Settings screen with [music] toggle (slider if desktop), [sound], [name], [color theme] & [reset] options.

* About screen with mapiSOFT name, music author, links to sites and twitters.

* Score counting and turn counting (should pop counts as a turn? *Or only pops should count as turns instead*)

* Count overall pops, unlock more story or something else with overall progress (and don't cut it from free version!)

** Leaderboard with best score in X amount of turns (best 30, best 50, best 100) -- ?
   Your best + 5/10 top players


*** Look into something grabbing, like a story in original Async Corp.


*** Look for YouTube let's players for promotion

*** Two versions for google play store: "swaps FREE" (with 50 turns limitation and $1 iap to unlock endless game)
    and a paid version for $1.5 (or maybe it should be the other way around)
    Make it deadly obvious that you have a 50 turns limitation right there on a "PLAY!" button
    IAP purchase available in the settings screen, and right after you've played your 50 turns limit (with the possibility to continue current play!)
*** Post this game to Amazon App store as well
*** Look into iOS App Store
