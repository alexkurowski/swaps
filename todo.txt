Current:

Main menu buttons for [about], [scores], [settings] & [messages], and put them on the screen.

Replays some of scary faces to happy and smiley ones. (like 9)

Read into Haptic.vibrate, it's too long & too weak currently.

Start thinking up tweets.





** Menu with [play], [settings], [scores] & [about] buttons ("PLAY!", gear icon, leader piedestal, "?" respectively)
  Also shows unlocked emoticons (but doesn't show number of locked emoticons, no one will probably see 6x6 one)

* Settings screen with [music] toggle (slider if desktop), [sound], [name], [color theme] & [reset] options.

* About screen with mapiSOFT name, music author, links to sites and twitters.

* Score counting and turn counting (should pop counts as a turn? *Or only pops should count as turns instead*)

* Count overall pops, unlock more story or something else with overall progress (and don't cut it from free version!)

** Leaderboard with best score in X amount of turns (best 30, best 50, best 100) -- ?
   Your best + 5/10 top players


*** Look into something grabbing, like a story in original Async Corp.


*** Look for YouTube let's players for promotion

*** Two versions for googe play store: "swaps FREE" (with 50 turns limitation and $1 iap to unlock endless game)
    and a paid version for $1.5 (or maybe it should be the other way around)
    Make it deadly obvious that you have a 50 turns limitation right there on a "PLAY!" button
    IAP purchase available in the settings screen, and right after you've played your 50 turns limit (with the possibility to continue current play!)
*** Post this game to Amazon App store as well
*** Look into iOS App Store
