= Player have to do only one action during the game
 - Stays the same, even if mechanics might change
 + Swap squares on a 3x3 board
 + Make one square touch its neighbour

= Visuals must be present
 - Simple, recognizable
 - Tied to the gameplay
 + Glossy square, robot, smile on its screen, white/pink on dark background

= Gameplay is the same during the whole game
 - Patterns might differ, but the main idea stays the same
 - End goal is not available from the beginning
  - Goals progressively adds with player's achievments
 - End goal isn't recognized by the player from the start
 - First introduce bricks, then introduce walls, then whole buildings, and so on

= Rewards are fast in the beginning, but get harder over time
 - It will come, if player will have to build on same main bricks even in the end
 - Less space to work with or tasks needed to progress gets longer

= Progress is easily recognized
 - Simply score system is a bad idea
 - Small or consistant numbers, or collectible objects
  - First you find banana, then mango, then pineapple
 + Show progress right there on the main menu screen

= Timing matters
 - Don't just do 'faster the better'
 - Make player wait a little for the result

= Social stuff
 - Leaderboard is good, but community platform is better
  - Too hard to do?
